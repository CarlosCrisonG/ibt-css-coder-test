# CSS Coder Test for Job Application at IBT

## Created by:

## NOTES
- I used Bootstrap v5.3 to build most of the site, but I also used flex so you can check I also handle Pure CSS. After all developer cannot stick toa framework or library

- I tried to give my best to setup everyting like in the prototype. However there are some differences that I had to solve on my own. For example, in the 2 images of the mobile view, the image with the mobile menu open looks like the secondary articles are shown full widh (This is much better for user experience on a mobile view). However the picture with the mobile menu closed, shows the secondary articles divided into two columns like in the desktop view (This forces to show everything smaller). I decided to build this last view, so I stick to the design given as model for general mobile view.

- Also, the general mobile view prototype looks darker. I wasn't sure if this was on porpuse or just an screenshot side effect. For this reason I decided to get the footer background darker in the mobile view only, as this could be a test of my skills.
